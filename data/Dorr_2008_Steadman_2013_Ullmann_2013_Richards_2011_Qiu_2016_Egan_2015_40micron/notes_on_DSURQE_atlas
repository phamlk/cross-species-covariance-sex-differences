Based on the following atlases:
* Dorr et.al., 2008, High resolution three-dimensional brain atlas using an average magnetic resonance image of 40 adult C57Bl/6J mice.
* Steadman et.al., 2014, Genetic effects on cerebellar structure across mouse models of autism using a magnetic resonance imaging atlas.
* Ullmann et.al., 2013, A segmentation protocol and MRI atlas of the C57BL/6J mouse neocortex.
* Richards et.al, 2011, Segmentation of the mouse hippocampal formation in magnetic resonance images.
* Shannon Egan (2015) – added olfactory bulb segmentation based on data from the Allen Brain Institute 
* Lily Qiu (2016) – added the medial amygdala and medial preoptic area

Compared to DSURE
=================
* added Medial amygdala (segmentated by Lily)
* added Medial preoptic nucleus (segmented by Lily)
--> these labels were mapped from the Dorr_2008 average (which was used for the segmentation) onto the 
    40 micron average. The segmentation should be cleaned up at some point
